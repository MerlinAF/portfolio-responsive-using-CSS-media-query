    <p><h2>Hello! I'm Merlin,</h2> A passionate florist and one of the florists at my church.As a passionate florist, I combine creativity with technical expertise to craft beautiful floral designs that not only brighten spaces but also convey emotions and stories.

      <li>
        <h4>Technical Skills and Knowledge:</h4>
        <p>I have a solid understanding of the technical side of floral design, from flower care to the mechanics of wiring and arranging. I make sure each bloom is treated with care and arranged to maintain both beauty and longevity.</p>
      </li>  
      <li>
        <h4>Attention to Detail:</h4>
        <p>Every stem, leaf, and petal matters. I am meticulous in my approach, ensuring that each arrangement is carefully planned and executed with precision. From choosing the right flowers to trimming them perfectly, I focus on every detail to make sure the final design is flawless.</p>
